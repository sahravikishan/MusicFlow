            <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
            <p>Welcome to MusicFlow ("Service"), a Django-based web application developed by Ravikishan Sah as a college project. By using the Service, you agree to these Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you do not agree, do not use the Service.</p>
            <p>The Service allows registered users to authenticate (signup, login, password reset) and generate music files (MIDI, WAV, MP3) using utilities like mido and midiutil, limited to acoustic guitar soundfont initially.</p>

        <section id="user-accounts">
            <h2>3. User Accounts</h2>
            <p>To access music generation, create an account via signup.html. You are responsible for accurate information, credential confidentiality, and notifying us of unauthorized use.</p>

            <p>Do not overload the system (limited to 10 concurrent users) or circumvent limitations like the acoustic guitar soundfont.</p>
